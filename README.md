# INTRODUCTION

This case study is aimed to understand the user data in our e-commerce based on different variables such as the time spent on our website and app as well as the amount spent. We firstly perform an exploratory data analysis to understand better the types of data we have as well as the distribution and then we will perform a K-Means clustering analysis to segment our user data into different clusters for future marketing activities.
